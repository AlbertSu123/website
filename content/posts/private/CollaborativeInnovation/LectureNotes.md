Hi y'all, I'm Albert! I was originally born in Canada but I moved to the states(California) when I was young and have been living in the bay area for basically my whole life. I honestly don't have any important experiences that have happened in my life, to be honest, it's been pretty cookie cutter though I'm working on changing that ðŸ˜…. Case in point: I'm a 3rd year Computer Science Major

I'm pretty passionate about decentralized finance and would love to hear other people's ideas and opinions about the space. Specifically, I'm interested in decentralized automated insurance, where we can replace complex claims arbitration with simple code that automatically pays out the amount you are entitled to without having to file claims. I'm also interested in creating decentralized markets for voting power that solves the third party voting problem.

I'm interested in the collaborative innovation class since I think it would be a cool way to meet cool people that are working/will work on cool things. I honestly don't know too much else about the class, but the syllabus and videos looks promising

What might you ask to learn your partner's experience in providing food?

Tell me about best/worst experience/feedback in that role
- Food poisoning from sushi

Would you do it again?

What themes emerge about what it is being a food provider? How are they seen by others?
After you've discussed for awhile, select one theme around which to generate ideas?

These apples look ugly, why should we eat them?
This stuff is so expensive, why should we purchase from you instead of walmart
