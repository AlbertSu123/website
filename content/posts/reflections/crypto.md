## Bullish on Team and Idea
Eigenlayer: You've probably heard of Eigenlayer by now. For me, Eigenlayer is one a project that has the potential to grow so big that it becomes an existential threat to Ethereum, since if the supply of re-staked ETH approaches the total supply of staked ETH, weird incentives around the Ethereum Consensus mechanism could happen - or worse yet, there is an exploit in one of Eigenlayers' contracts. The reason for Eigenlayer's near guarenteed success is simple: anything that can be innovated on in the Ethereum ecosystem will be tested with Eigenlayer first. The main risks to Eigenlayer are also close to solved. Eigenlayer needs to grow fast enough to generate an ecosystem of applications that use restaked ETH, otherwise they risk someone forking their ecosystem and giving a bit less of their tokens to investors. k

Additionally, the team is a powerhouse. Instead of being a collection of anons that met on the internet, Sreeram Kanaan brought his entire research lab from the University of Washington - Seattle, a top 10 CS research university. Having met a few of the team, here are some highlights: 
- Sreeram: Professor at UW, Postdoc at Stanford and UC Berkeley. He's one of those rare people who has massive raw brainpower. I learned more about consensus mechanisms in 1 hour talking to this man than in the previous six months.
- Gautam: A paradigm fellow, a child genius who only eats frozen vegetables and hard boiled eggs for entire weeks since "life is too comfortable"
- CryptoBanker: Has found multiple exploits in live contracts as a whitehat
- Bowen, Shoubik, and the rest of the lab: PhDs at UW, nuff said.

Hot take: One year after Eigenlayer launches, it will have the highest TVL in all of Crypto.

### TVL is fake
People fake TVL all the time. Whether through recursive lending/borrowing, liquidity mining rewards, or a waves play, what you see if often not what you get. However, some projects and firms take this one step further where they make deals to pledge some portion of project tokens in exchange for a certain TVL amount. Some examples of this include platypus finance,
