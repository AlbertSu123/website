## Bullish on Team and Idea
Eigenlayer: You've probably heard of Eigenlayer by now. For me, Eigenlayer is one a project that has the potential to grow so big that it becomes an existential threat to Ethereum, since if the supply of re-staked ETH approaches the total supply of staked ETH, weird incentives around the Ethereum Consensus mechanism could happen - or worse yet, there is an exploit in one of Eigenlayers' contracts. The reason for Eigenlayer's near guarenteed success is simple: anything that can be innovated on in the Ethereum ecosystem will be tested with Eigenlayer first. The main risks to Eigenlayer are also close to solved. Eigenlayer needs to grow fast enough to generate an ecosystem of applications that use restaked ETH, otherwise they risk someone forking their ecosystem and giving a bit less of their tokens to investors. k

Additionally, the team is a powerhouse. Instead of being a collection of anons that met on the internet, Sreeram Kanaan brought his entire research lab from the University of Washington - Seattle, a top 10 CS research university. Having met a few of the team, here are some highlights: 
- Sreeram: Professor at UW, Postdoc at Stanford and UC Berkeley. He's one of those rare people who has massive raw brainpower. I learned more about consensus mechanisms in 1 hour talking to this man than in the previous six months.
- Gautam: A paradigm fellow, a child genius who only eats frozen vegetables and hard boiled eggs for entire weeks since "life is too comfortable"
- CryptoBanker: Has found multiple exploits in live contracts as a whitehat
- Bowen, Shoubik, and the rest of the lab: PhDs at UW, nuff said.

Hot take: One year after Eigenlayer launches, it will have the highest TVL in all of Crypto.

# Things you might not have know

### TVL is fake
People fake TVL all the time. Whether through recursive lending/borrowing, liquidity mining rewards, or a waves play, what you see if often not what you get. However, some projects and firms take this one step further where they make deals to pledge some portion of project tokens in exchange for a certain TVL amount. Some examples of this include platypus finance, where alameda deposited hundreds of millions in stablecoins and dumped the tokens that they received from the team.

### Random list of protocols that probably have an exploit or two in them
- [Compound forks](https://defillama.com/forks/Compound) on weird EVM alt L1s. Compound is safe protocol. Compound forks are not safe protocols. There are a wide variety of possible exploits on a compound fork:
  - if you use bad oracles, you will get flash loaned and drained
  - even if you have flash loan checks, the prices of the least liquid token can probably be manipulated, as there usually isn't too much liquidity on an alt L1.
  - If you have a single ERC-777 or ERC-677 token, someone will hit you with a reentrancy attack
  - If you use an old version of the compound v2 codebase, you will get hit with the `.transfer()` hack, the same one that stole 80 million from the Fei pool in Rari

### Tiers of DeFi Teams
There's basically three tiers of DeFi Teams
Tier 1: 30+ people, basically the MakerDAOs and the Uniswaps of the world. They usually have strong PMF and are heavily recognized, they ship open sourced code in addition to working on their project, and generally try to advance the industry in addition to their own projects.

Tier 2: Top End: Frax Finance, Bottom End: Saddle Finance. This is a barebones team, where there is at least one person covering each of the major facets required to run a DeFi project. They usually have one of each of the following: Solidity Engineer, Frontend Engineer, Designer(usually contracted), business lead(basically takes all the calls), community lead(sometimes combined with business lead, basically someone to sit in discord all day), and founder. Fun fact, legal action will destroy them, as they have no bandwidth or money to deal with that.

Tier 3: This is either a solo dev or an anon "team" of devs. It usually takes them a while to get going since they are basically a one man show, telegram takes a while for a response, things don't ship very quickly, tweets usually happen at most once a day, etc. I know this because I did this in the past.
