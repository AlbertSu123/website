Note: I am not the UC Berkeley 4.0 :{
### Midterm 1

Always over study for midterm 1, you don't know how well your classmates will do on the tests nor the structure and format for the tests, thus, you need to be extra prepared.

### One Day Before the Exam, you haven't started studying. What do you do?

Watch every single lecture and take notes. If you have time left, "Give your brain the tools to do the problems, eventually when you are under enough pressure, your brain will do it for you."

"If you do practice problems, you will be really good at the practice problems. But if you get a problem that you haven't seen before, you won't get it. Going over the lecture and notes is much more important."

"Optimally, go through all the lectures and take notes, then go back and fill in the notes(since if you are watching lecture it should move too fast for you. Then do the discussions which should now be pretty easy(except if the discussion is full of old exam questions). Then, you are chilling, you donâ€™t even need to take practice tests" A day or two before the exam, take 2-3 hours and split your cheat sheet into the number of lectures, then fill in your cheat sheet according to the lecture."

### Why do you succeed when other berkeley students fail?

Up to +1 std deviations, it's just work. Up to +2 std deviations, it's just talent. So many kids are afraid of leaving questions blank, in 170 and 162, I left one subpart blank. Don't skip questions, but it is coding, its fine to skip. If the point total is too little for the work, come back to it later.

### Do you forget stuff after classes are over?

No, I just remember stuff.

### Translating skills from class to work?

"I've never tried leetcode"

### Homeworks

"I just sit down and do it starting at 8 in the morning the day it is due. If I'm not feeling it, I just won't do the homework" Note: This man didn't do 3 homeworks in algorithms even though you only have two homework drops

### Piazza

"I fucking hate piazza(online forum to ask questions) cause they are fucking dumbasses on there. 170 was the first time since the problems are too much to do by yourself. When people leave how they've done problems, then that is useful to look. " It's better to talk to people in real life that you know to bounce ideas off of.

### Have you ever gotten worse than an A in a class?

Yeah, in AP Calc B. Because I played too many video games
