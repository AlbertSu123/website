# Unit 2-Native Americans
## Federal Trust Doctrine
Theory: Guardianship Theory, tribes need a guardian.
Legal Doctrine: Trust Doctrine, Wardship vs Sovereignty

### Reservations
Crow Reservation in Montana - owns 20% of land
Other tribes own 5% of land in reservation
Types of Reservation: Tribal lands, Allotted Lands, Indian Homestead

### Allotment and Assimilation 1887-1934
Tribes were viewed as wards of the state
Kagama v United States 1886
General Allotment - Dawes Act 1887
Natives were meant to adopt cultural norms - ie being agrarian
Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs didn't look out for native tribes

### Kagama v United States 1886
Two Indians murdered another Indian
Issue: Indian murder case raised issue of federal jurisdiction vs tribal jurisdiction
Decision: Feds have jurisdiction on reservations in certain cases
Implication: Trust Doctrine was interpreted under the assumption that warship is the essence of the relationship of feds and tribes

### Dawes Act 1887
Divides tribal holdings into private allotments
Property rights: tribal community > private trust patent > private fee patent
Incorporation: acculturation > assimilation = path to citizenship

Outcomes:
  - **Land loss:** Taxes, private sale, surplus land auctions
  - **Dependency:** Land loss, pauperization, acculturation, no viable political institution

### Indian New Deal 1934-1953
Cultural pluralism < 1920s
Great Depression 1929-1941
Indian Reorganization Act 1934

### House Concurrent Resolution 108 1953
  - Ends federal trust responsibilities
  - New version of allotment
  - Division of surplus lands
  - Terminates 61 tribes 
  - Escape from Trust Doctrine bind

### Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act 1975
  - Amendments 1998/1996
  - Trust Doctrine: Sovereignty?
  - Incorporation: traditionalism + Modernization
