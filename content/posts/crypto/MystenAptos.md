Mysten raised 200m at 2B
Facebook started Libra->Diem->Novi in 2018. Zuck found the 25 smartest engineers, gave them a ton of money, and told them to build the best blockchain ever!
Unfortunately, washington DC was not very kind to facebook and facebook decided to red-tape the Novi project, the technology was very interesting, but it was regulations that caused the end of it.
Aptos + Mysten = Novi team
Ethereum Virtual Machine orders transactions and settles them onto blockchains
Move has objects which should allow the blockchain to realize which category objects fall under(similar to cadence)
It is extremely rare for two teams to launch a blockchain at the same time with the same tech, thus it would be a go to market battle. FTX announced an investment into Mysten(might have also invested into Aptos). FTX says they aren't leaving solana
