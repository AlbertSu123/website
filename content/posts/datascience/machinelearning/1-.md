# TODO
Put readings on todo list can be found on class webpage
Put homeworks on todo list
Midterm 1 Monday march 16 in class
Discussion sections Monday-Wednesday

# Core material
- Find patterns in data and use them to make predictions
- Models + stats help us understand patterns
- Use optimization algorithms to learn the patterns

## Classification
- Simplest Case: you have two choices, given data, make a prediction
- Knn best when few outliers

### Classifying Numbers
1. Turn points into grid of 0s and 1s based on the color of the grid
2. Turn grid into a vector by flattening the vector
3. Create hyperplane in the n-dimensional space to group things

### Testing and Validation
- **Train a classifier** - it learns to distinguish 7 from not 7
- Test the classifier on NEW images
- There are two types of error
    - **Training set error:** Fraction of training images not classified correctly
    - **Test set error:** Fraction of misclassified NEW images, not seen during training
- **Outliers:** Points whose labels are atypical (e.g solvent borrowers who defaulted anyway)
- **Overfitting:** When the test error deteriorates because the classifier becomes too sensitive to outliers
- **Hyperparameters:** Most ML algorithms have a few hyperparameters that control over/underfitting. eg k in k-nearest neighbors

## Select classifiers by validation
- **Validation Set:** Hold back a subset of the labeled data 
- Train the classifier multiple times with different hyperparameter settings
- Choose setting(hyperparameter + learning algorithm) that works best on validation set

Now, we have 3 sets:
- **Training set:** Used to learn model weights
- **Validation set:** Used to tune hyperparameters, choose among different models
- **Test set:** Used as FINAL evaluation. Test set kept in vault, ran once, at the very end

Kaggle.com
- Runs ML competitions, including our HWs
- We use 2 data sets: 
    - public set labels available during the competition
    - private set labels known only to Kaggles

# Techniques of Machine Learning Taught in Class

## Supervised learning
- Classification: Is this email spam?
- Regression: How likely does this patient have cancer?

## Unsupervised learning
- Clustering: which DNA sequences are similar to each other?
- Dimensionality Reduction: What are common features of faces?
