## Motivation
Get the minimum of a function

## Intuition
- To the left of a minimum, derivative is negative(going down)
- To the right of a minimum, derivative is positive(going up)
- **Convexity:** If you draw a line between two points, all values on curve need to be on or below that line.
- Problem: gradient descent finds the local minimum
