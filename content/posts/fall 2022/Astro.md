Wiens Law: Wavelength * temperature = constant
stefan boltzmann Law: Per unit surface area, hot opaque thermal emitters give off much more energy than cold opaque ones
energy emitted per cm^2 = constant * temperature^4
Luminosity = Total energy emitted per second by the entire object
L = surface area * (energy emitted/cm^2 s)
L = A*E = A*sigma*T^4
L = 4*pi*R^2*sigma*T^4

Telescopes:
Primary purpose is to collect more light
Large telescopes have diameter of 6m
Dialated eye pupil has a diameter of 6mm

Area = pi * R^2 = pi * D^2/4
Ratio of Area = (Diameter 2/Diameter 2)^2
Clarity = wavelength of light / lens diameter
