n = number of sample points
d = number of features (per point)
= dimensions of sample pts
i,j,k = indices
f(),s() = functions

Inner product (dot product)
also written x^T y
clearly f(x) = w * x + a is a linear function in x

Euclidean norm
||X|| = sqrt(x*x)
Given a vector x, x / ||X|| is a unit vector with length 1

Normalize a vector
replace x with x / ||X|| 

## Classifiers
- You are given a sample of n observations, each with d features(aka predictors)
- some observations belong to class C, some do not
- represents each observation as a point in d-dimensional space, called a sample point/feature vector/independent variables

decision boundary: boundary chosen by classifier to separate item in the class from those not

overfitting: When sinuous decision boundary fits sample points so well that it doesn't classify future points well

decision function: a functions f(x) that maps a sample point to a scalar such that 
```
f(x) > 0 if x is in class C
f(x) <= 0 if x is not in class C
