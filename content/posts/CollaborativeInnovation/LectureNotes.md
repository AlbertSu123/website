# Lecture 2

## Innovation Frame
- Abstract Conceptualization
- Reflective Observation (Why?)
- Active Experimentation (How?)
- Concrete Experience

What might you ask to learn your partner's experience in providing food?
What roles have you played in food preparation?
- Go to restaurants or get food from restaurants or go to the grocery store(trader joes)
- Pizza, pasta, salad, frozen chicken. Something, everyone eats. 
Tell me about best/worst experience/feedback in that role
- Food poisoning from sushi

Would you do it again?

What themes emerge about what it is being a food provider? How are they seen by others?
After you've discussed for awhile, select one theme around which to generate ideas?

These apples look ugly, why should we eat them?
This stuff is so expensive, why should we purchase from you instead of walmart
