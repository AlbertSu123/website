Read the task centered design process and write a response

In December 2018, everyone in Hawaii got a missile notification warning them to get to shelter immediately. 

Goal: Reliably build very good interactive systems with a focus on interactions with and through intelligent systems(AI)

Concrete goal: Build a working interactive prototype

Emphasis on fieldwork, rapid prototyping, user testing to find right design and avoid obvious and not-so-obvious mistakes.

Human: End user of program
Computer: Machine program runs on
Interaction: User tells computer what they want. Computer communicate results

**User interfaces:** Part of application that allows people to interact with computer and for the computer to communicate results.
In today's applications, an average of 48% of the code is devoted to the user interface portion.

## When would a center console consisting of a touchscreen(Tesla) vs a center console of multiple buttons(ie Ineos car)
- Pixels are flexible and good for dense information display
- Screen Controls require you to look at them, while you can feel for touch control

As the UI designer, you are the voice of the user.

## Brainstorming
Divergent: Increasing the number of ideas
Convergent: Reduce the number of ideas
Aim for quantity, hope for quality
Number your ideas: Helps keep track of the idea, gives ideas its own identity
Build and Jump: Build to keep momentum on an idea
Jump to regain momentum when a theme tapers out
Concept Refinement: Premature idea rejection is a serious barrier to good design. One big differentiator between good designers and great ones is the ability to generate unusual ideas
The Space Remembers: Covering whiteboards or papering walls with text is extremely useful for group work. It is a effective form of shared RAM for the group.

### How to criticize 
Point out positive aspects - be specific
Not: I like this, but ...
Instead The layout effectively communicates the hierarchical nature of the data, however...

Ask for alternatives instead of offering solutions
Not: You should change X
Instead: have you considered alternatives to X

## Inquires
Understand users and their tasks. Just watch them and record them, don't say or do anything. Use a master apprentice model where the user is the master and you are the apprentice. To get them to agree to let them watch you, tell them you are a student and doing this for a class project or pay them or get one of their colleagues to get them interested.

## Affordances
Relationship between the properties of a physical object and the capabilities of a person that determine how the object is use

Chair affords sitting
Chair affords lifting
Knobs afford turning, pulling
Buttons afford pressing
Glass affords viewing, breaking

### Signifiers
Help people figure out the affordances of objects without labels or instructions
Chair affords sitting(since there is a flat surface held by legs)
Buttons afford pressing (it looks like it fits our fingertip)
Glass affords viewing, breaking (you can already see through it)
