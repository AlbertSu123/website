In December 2018, everyone in Hawaii got a missile notification warning them to get to shelter immediately. 

Goal: Reliably build very good interactive systems with a focus on interactions with and through intelligent systems(AI)

Concrete goal: Build a working interactive prototype

Emphasis on fieldwork, rapid prototyping, user testing to find right design and avoid obvious and not-so-obvious mistakes.

Human: End user of program
Computer: Machine program runs on
Interaction: User tells computer what they want. Computer communicate results

**User interfaces:** Part of application that allows people to interact with computer and for the computer to communicate results.
In today's applications, an average of 48% of the code is devoted to the user interface portion.
