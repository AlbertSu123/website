# Before Classes Start:

- **Figure out who is the best GSI(Graduate Student Instruction)**
  - There's a big gap between the best and work GSIs/UGSIs at Cal. Try to figure out which GSI is the best(usually a combination of semesters on course staff, if they are a head TA, if they have resources for the class that aren't official class materials <- this one is huge because it shows that they care). Attend all of their discussion, labs, and office hours and if you do, you pretty much have at least an A- in the class.

# When moving to a new apartment

- **Take a slow moving video before/right after moving in to prevent getting sued for damages**

# Osmosis Office

- Osmosis has an office in berkeley, iykyk
