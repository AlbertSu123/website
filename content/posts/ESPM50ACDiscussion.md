# Unit 2-Native Americans

## Inventing the Indian and Indian Policy

**Bob Haozous believes:**

- Bloodlines aren't enough to make one Indian
- Doesn't believe lifestyle justifies
- Not superior to others
- He is NOT dependent on Indian Speak to maintain indigenous Identity

Answer: He is NOT dependent on Indian Speak to maintain indigenous Identity

**Noble Savages are not:**

- Innocent
- Intelligent
- Violent
- Strong Intuition

Answer: Violent

Native americans didn't have any attachment to a specific piece of land - kidwell

Yurok management regimes in california can be described as forest for people

## Painting Analysis

**Noble Savages**

![NobleSavagePortrait](/media/ESPM50ACDiscussion/IndianTypes/Noble Indian.JPG)

- Very romanticized image
- Indians portrayed as noble but savage, emotional, sensible, intelligent, but savage in a way of not being modern
- In touch with nature and innocent
- Talented at hunting, horseback riding, and other knowledge
- Implication of being primitive through looks and clothing, etc but dignified in manners and peaceful, suggesting some greater knowledge

**Brutal Savages**

![BrutalSavagePortrait](/media/ESPM50ACDiscussion/IndianTypes/Brutal Indian.JPG)

- Violent and aggressive
- Happened around time of territorial expansion: native americans were trying to expand
- Brutal portrayal of natives for this reason
- Barrier to manifest destiny
- Stereotype led to the indian removal act
- Indians also in a state of chronic warfare at the time too, had aggressive attitudes towards western expansions

**Conquered People**

![ConqueredIndianPortrait](/media/ESPM50ACDiscussion/IndianTypes/Conquered Indian.JPG)

- Indians are separated from modern society
- The white colonial settlers are expanded throughout the frontier via technology (the train in the photo)
- The Natives are currently unable to cross the divide between the societies
- The looking at the train can be seen as a sign of hope for their future assimilation, but still currently very separated which can be represented by the valley between them
- Colonial settlers already established in native lands
- No assimilation into colonist society yet
- Native peoples symbolically pushed up and away from civilization
- Pushing of Christianity

**Dependent Indian**

![DependentIndianPortrait](/media/ESPM50ACDiscussion/IndianTypes/Dependent Indian.JPG)

- Losing territories
- Economic dependence
  -Government see tribes as independent
- Paternalistic idea of state as guardian and the new generation is going to domesticated assimilated through education

**Ecological Indian**

![EcologicalIndianPortrait](/media/ESPM50ACDiscussion/IndianTypes/Ecological Indian.JPG)

- Indian man who seems to be in pain from seeing the environment die, used by industry/government and other agencies as a form of propaganda to push their agenda
- Places Native American experience on a pedestal and as a prime example of environmentalism without addressing systemic injustices that contribute to climate change
- Limiting view of Native American culture because the Native American experience is often more nuanced and complex than is portrayed
- Krech: Not all Native American practices are sustainable for the environment and could often be wasteful, a lot of practices are done with a great deal of uncertainty (e.g. beargrass, fires, etc.)
- Oversimplifies Native peoples and their relationship with the environment

**Independent Indian**

![IndependentIndianPortrait](/media/ESPM50ACDiscussion/IndianTypes/Independent Indian.JPG)

- Emergence of Multiculturalism
- Appear behind the US flag, could relate to how they felt
- Indians being treated differently → Trying to become independent
- Indigenous activism that aligns with the Civil Rights Movement
- Tribal Government: More sovereignty
- Self-identification: they can choose whether to be traditionalist, modernist, or a hybrid
- More self representing, but within mainstream media, remain tokenized, not able to portray themselves in an accurate light
- Expression of self-confidence, anger
- Reclaiming american iconography

**Capital:** Surplus financial resources to be used for investment
**Capitalist class:** Owners of surplus money resources deployed as capital investment
**Means of production:** Physical inputs used in production

### Externality

- Productive activity that has consequences for another thing or activity but not reflected in market price
- Can create environmental degradation, unjust distribution of social costs
- Costs are not account for in market value

### Profits vs Surplus Value

- Neoclassical Difference between costs of production and wages -> belongs to the property owner
- Does profit belong to the capitalist or the workers?
- Should profits go to the holder of property rights or do people have rights to what was produced
- Does the state have a role in redistributing some profits back to workers
- What are the implications for the use of profit as an incentive for innovation efficiency, productivity, etc.

## Richard Walker: California's Golden Road to Riches

The gifts of nature alone are not enough to explain california's success.
Property regime
Regional capital accumulation
Resource industrialization

## Week 10: Section discussion worksheet

Directions:
(1) Summarize Walker’s four principal components of “California’s high road to development (p. 168)” regarding California’s economic development and (2) explain how the point supports his overall argument.

Group 1 and 5: The Property regime: Prospector California (pp. 178-81)
Group 2 and 6: Regional Accumulation: Money, Circulation, and Finance (pp. 181-84)
Group 3 and 7: Resource Industrialization: Manufacturing Nature (pp. 184-87)
Group 4 and 8: The Prospector State: Government and Politics (pp. 187-90)

### Group 1: The Property regime: Prospector California (pp. 178-81)

Made property private property - strengthened capitalism and capitalist class as controlling class
Extraction and exploitation of resources - applies to CA’s gifts of nature - lots of resources available in CA that can be given value when labor production
Turn the public domain into private property as fast as possible
Class that held small property greatly contributed to economic growth through plundering, conquering, building, investing, etc.
Workers were more skilled, better paid than other working classes - very much not desperate poor - helped contribute to economic growth of CA
Every type of laborer was in demand - land of opportunity - aspirations of success
Skilled workers sought opportunity to rise above and make better wages and have a better life out west, and unskilled workers were in high demand for labor
Everyone was trying to become owners and capitalists

### Group 2: Regional Accumulation: Money, Circulation, and Finance (pp. 181-84)

Sticky hands - resource wealth stuck around in California (gold)
Financing; loans, credit ticket system, labor recruitment networks and $50 passage
Regional capitalism grounded in the wealth of nature - capital accumulation
Retention of wealth within California, turning natural resources into capital
Financial paradox of railroad building
Railroads were needed for economic development but wouldn’t be making any money as long as there was no economic development
Capital Piles Up - large concentrations of capital rose from vortex of resource extraction and commerce
Reinvestment - deepening of extractive activities, expansion of the commercial network, diversification into multifaceted industrial pursuit
Much of the capital (profits) was put back into creating more capital
Sticky hands led to capital piling up, which led to reinvestment
Sticky hands: profit stayed in CA
Resources available in CA got this accumulation started
Went back into modes of production - gold from gold extraction paid for further gold extraction
Capital piling up:
Acquisitions, business alliances, real estate, banking, and securities speculation
Concentrated in SF and LA due to financial patterns of the West
Purchasing water rights, oil
Spread from NorCal to SoCal
Reinvestment
Deepening of extractive activities
Expansion of commercial network
Diversification into every manner of industrial pursuit
Resources got them started, but money stayed in California
Surplus stayed in cali
Modes of production ex gold extraction went back to gold extraction
Stayed relevant regardless of natural resource
Capital piling up urban real estate purchasing water rights for agriculture
Norcal so cal oil
Reinvestment: extraction, commercial expansion and industrial pursuit

### Group 3: Resource Industrialization: Manufacturing Nature (pp. 184-87)

Means of growing wealth
Rural extraction —> industry
Resource extraction and industry linked together
Technology and innovation
Developing tech unlocks access to more natural resources —> cycle
R&D in tech, machinery, development, etc.
Manufacturing adds value to nature and natural resources
Having the whole commodity chain (extraction to trade) in California kept profits in the state, which were often invested in California
Mining and timber production as well as the consumer market were in California
Natural resource processing, equipment supply for extraction, secondary demand for resource products, technical innovation

### Group 4: The Prospector State: Government and Politics (pp. 187-90)

State has a government that serves the interest of capital with an institutionalized framework
Institutional framework (land distribution, accumulation of capital, removal of native people)
Imposition of tax → low (no tax for white, tax for non white)
Promoter and subsidizer (railroad, highway, infrastructure
These promotions and subsidies created above state infrastructure which were key to commerce, resource extraction, jobs and manufacturing → led to accumulation of wealth
Federal and state water distribution and rights were also important as you need water for mining and agriculture
Cooperative Businesses
Public Interest
Recognition of the value of the environment, people, and communities
State and municipalities pursue policy of key public resources
Regulating hazards and public ownership of key resources to the state
Social Contract
Built around recognition of the environment, some recognition of the value of people and communities
Conservative state
A place of limited regulation, moderate form of politics; domination of republican interest
Political parties are less important in CA than other states which gets in the way of a successful economy
State focus on the diffusion of technology (development of Silicon Valley)
State tried to spur technology through investment, investment in university system or allowing profit motives to exist

### Group 5: The Property regime: Prospector California (pp. 178-81)

How individuals, and firms access resources
Private property from public domain as rapidly as possible
Pursuit of wealth is motivated through property rights b/c they assure that you get the rewards based on the risks you take if you have property rights in the things you’re exploiting.  
Property rights often excluded natives, Hispanic workers, and immigrants
Weren’t able to access lands because they couldn’t assert their property rights as effectively
Institutionalizes forms of motivation and reward
Small property owners played a significant role in settlement
Gold Rush: “mass squat on public land,” oil exploration was also significant, lumber, farming, fishing were all prospected as well
Resource prospecting led to things like permanent impermanence and new forms of government
Wages were very high during this period due to Callifornia’s natural wealth
Workers joined the workingman’s party and were footloose(willing to move for work)
Labor shortage meant wages also high and less competition
Big Capital
Small capital was not necessarily the yeoman farmer, rather, they wanted to become the big capitalists, be it fishermen turning into cannery owners to people wanting to strike it rich in startups
“Vigorous struggle for supremacy in which big capital always held the beest cards, but small property had the numbers to keep economy and political relations unsettled”
Wealth stayed in california since prospectors saw the chance to become even richer

### Group 6: Regional Accumulation: Money, Circulation, and Finance (pp. 181-84)

Financial center of global significance
California’s build up of capital had three moments
Resource wealth turning to money in local hands
Money piling up into big capital stocks
Capital investment swirling back into the economy
“Sticky hands” regional accumulation of wealth way resource wealth stuck around in California instead of carried away to distant cities and foreign powers
A class of big capitalists repeatedly rose:
Deep mining concentrated wealth faster than placer mining
Another class of capitalists were the city merchants who made profits from wheat, timber, wax, clothing, automobiles materials and other necessities
The new Bourgeoisie learned to attract new investors to California by showing off the accumulation of wealth from resource extraction and commerce.
Also rationalized operations through partnerships and incorporation
CA became a major banking center
Its system was built on savings and profits from the resource sector

### Group 7: Resource Industrialization: Manufacturing Nature (pp. 184-87)

Industry “spat” out materials of earth
Symbiotic relationship between industry and extraction
Road to capitalism was built on “agro-industry”
Expansion of division of labor
Connection between resource extraction and industry

Four facets:
Resource processing: Natural resource industrialization goes beyond extraction, pretty much everything needs to be processed in some way. In California, the largest “manufacturers” were actually mills and refineries for sugar, flour, and metals. Went from 4% to 16% of the workforce from 1880 to 1920.
Machinery and equipment demand: The industrial process requires tools, and mining, farm, and oil equipment were the most important in California until after WWII.
Secondary demand: Greatest demand in cities and towns; SF and Sacramento built a “home market” the houses “swallowed a whole forrest”
Technical innovation:
Most of california’s resources required technology to discover/”unlock”
California had difficulty in development because all of the resources we had required progressive tech to use
“Every resource sector has its own rich story of dominion over nature”
California mining equipment was exported widely and it was used in trading with Australia to South Africa
California’s innovation and capitalism is intrinsically linked since the development came from extractive technologies, manufacturing, etc

## Remaining Questions

1. Not superior to others -> Who isn't superior to others?
