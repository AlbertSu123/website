## Painting Analysis

**Noble Savages**

![NobleSavagePortrait](/media/ESPM50ACDiscussion/IndianTypes/Noble Indian.JPG)
  - Very romanticized image
  - Indians portrayed as noble but savage, emotional, sensible, intelligent, but savage in a way of not being modern
  - In touch with nature and innocent
  - Talented at hunting, horseback riding, and other knowledge
  - Implication of being primitive through looks and clothing, etc but dignified in manners and peaceful, suggesting some greater knowledge

**Brutal Savages**

![BrutalSavagePortrait](/media/ESPM50ACDiscussion/IndianTypes/Brutal Indian.JPG)
  - Violent and aggressive
  - Happened around time of territorial expansion: native americans were trying to expand
  - Brutal portrayal of natives for this reason
  - Barrier to manifest destiny
  - Stereotype led to the indian removal act
  - Indians also in a state of chronic warfare at the time too, had aggressive attitudes towards western expansions

**Conquered People**

![ConqueredIndianPortrait](/media/ESPM50ACDiscussion/IndianTypes/Conquered Indian.JPG)
  - Indians are separated from modern society
  - The white colonial settlers are expanded throughout the frontier via technology (the train in the photo)
  - The Natives are currently unable to cross the divide between the societies 
  - The looking at the train can be seen as a sign of hope for their future assimilation, but still currently very separated which can be represented by the valley between them
  - Colonial settlers already established in native lands
  - No assimilation into colonist society yet
  - Native peoples symbolically pushed up and away from civilization 
  - Pushing of Christianity

**Dependent Indian**

![DependentIndianPortrait](/media/ESPM50ACDiscussion/IndianTypes/Dependent Indian.JPG)
  - Losing territories 
  - Economic dependence
  -Government see tribes as independent 
  - Paternalistic idea of state as guardian and the new generation is going to domesticated assimilated through education

**Ecological Indian**

![EcologicalIndianPortrait](/media/ESPM50ACDiscussion/IndianTypes/Ecological Indian.JPG)
  - Indian man who seems to be in pain from seeing the environment die, used by industry/government and other agencies as a form of propaganda to push their agenda
  - Places Native American experience on a pedestal and as a prime example of environmentalism without addressing systemic injustices that contribute to climate change
  - Limiting view of Native American culture because the Native American experience is often more nuanced and complex than is portrayed
  - Krech: Not all Native American practices are sustainable for the environment and could often be wasteful, a lot of practices are done with a great deal of uncertainty (e.g. beargrass, fires, etc.)
  - Oversimplifies Native peoples and their relationship with the environment

**Independent Indian**

![IndependentIndianPortrait](/media/ESPM50ACDiscussion/IndianTypes/Independent Indian.JPG)
  - Emergence of Multiculturalism
  - Appear behind the US flag, could relate to how they felt
  - Indians being treated differently â†’ Trying to become independent
  - Indigenous activism that aligns with the Civil Rights Movement
  - Tribal Government: More sovereignty
  - Self-identification: they can choose whether to be traditionalist, modernist, or a hybrid
  - More self representing, but within mainstream media, remain tokenized, not able to portray themselves in an accurate light 
  - Expression of self-confidence, anger 
  - Reclaiming american iconography

## Remaining Questions
1. Not superior to others -> Who isn't superior to others?
