## Anchor stuffs

Goal: Build gauntlet style assessment of risks to anchor investors.
Tool: agent based modeling. Either build out tooling that takes arbitrary terra contracts and turn them into simulatable protocols. Build out mock in python/julia that approximates contracts

We want a positive view on anchor :) ?
Need to articulate problems: yield reserves, dependency of other protocols on anchor(correlated risk), not enough people borrow
No mainnet forking on terra

## Questions:
Local terra with permissions?
Terra state is on AWS - 3G, has every terra transaction ever!
